(beat)          What happened to your parents?   ANYA          I don't know - I don't remember          anything that happened before          the revolution. . .    DMITRI          You know, it's strange -          Anastasia's grandmother, the          Dowager Empress Tatiana has          been looking for Anastasia          since the revolution.  Why do          you think she wouldn't go to          her own grandmother?   ANYA          I don't know.  I don't see what          this has to do with me.   DMITRI          Perhaps it's because she has          amnesia too - can't remember. . .   VLADIMIR          How much do you weigh?   VLADIMIR (CONT.)                  (to Dmitri)          I was just wondering since we          already have the dress. . .     ANYA          Look, I came here to get papers          to travel to Paris and. . .   DMITRI          Why do you want to go to Paris?   ANYA                  (defiant)          I have my reasons.   DMITRI          Anastasia's grandmother is in          Paris.  We're going to bring          Anastasia to her - in Paris.   (MORE)   DMITRI (CONT.)                  (beat)          And I think you are the          Princess Anastasia.   DMITRI (CON'T)          You never thought of the          possibility?   ANYA          Look - there isn't an orphan in          the world who doesn't dream          she's a princess but, come          on. . .  Look at me!   DMITRI          NO!  YOU LOOK AT HER!  LOOK AT          HER!                  (beat, then softly)          It could be you.   DMITRI (CONT.)          You don't have anything to          lose.  If I am wrong - the          Empress will simply tell us you          aren't Anastasia and we'll be          on our way.  No harm done - an          honest mistake - but at least          you will be in Paris.   ANYA                  (singing in a whisper)          THINGS MY HEART USED TO KNOW          THINGS IT YEARNS TO REMEMBER. . .   DMITRI          Find out the truth - come to          Paris with us.   ANYA          All right.  I will go with you.   DMITRI          The Her Royal Highness Princess          Anastasia!   BARTOK          Oy. . .  he's gonna be so mad. . .    ANYA                  (singing in a whisper)          THINGS MY HEART USED TO KNOW          THINGS IT YEARNS TO REMEMBER ...   DMITRI          Find out the truth - come to          Paris with us.   ANYA          All right. I will go with you.   DMITRI          The Her Royal Highness Princess          Anastasia!   BARTOK          Oy. . .  he's gonna be so mad...   BARTOK          Ummm ... Father Gregori? It's,          uhh ... me. Bartok.                  (a sign of relief)          Phew! Not home ...   RASPUTIN          What?   BARTOK          Oh my God!                  (wing to chest)          Don't do that ... feel my heart.          Go ahead. I'm dying here ...   RASPUTIN                  (smiling)          And what do you want, my little          rat-with-wings?   BARTOK          Name calling! That's mature.   RASPUTIN          I gave you that tongue and I          can rip it out!   BARTOK                  (strangled)          No, I really like my tongue...          we're very attached.                  (rasputin releases him)          Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise          you won't get angry.   RASPUTIN                  (sweetly)          Why would I ever be angry with          you, little friend?   BARTOK          Yeah, right. Keep that thought          okay? So, I'm in town, stop by          the old palace. You get a better          class of bats there - no tattoos          or anything.   BARTOK (CONT.)          So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and...          what can I say, I struck out. I          thought chicks would like the fact          that I can talk, you know but,          I mean, the way things are going          I couldn't get invited to a plague.                  (a bottle smashes)          Someone's gotta clean that up...   RASPUTIN          Get to the point sometime tonight..          I'm late for a wenching.   BARTOK          Okay... you're not gonna like this          but, well, it looks like Anastasia          is ... still alive.   RASPUTIN          Impossible. That rumor's been          around for years.   BARTOK          Trust me, it's her!   RASPUTIN                  (eyes narrowing)          How do you know?   BARTOK          Rodent's intuition, how do I know?          She looks exactly like her.          Except she's taller,          which     is natural ... Of course          my second cousin Treplev - he          never     grew. Looks like a          little pepper shaker. He was          so cute ...   BARTOK (CONT. )          Oyyy... I knew this was gonna          to upset him!   RASPUTIN                  (with reverence)          Source of my power. Owner of          my soul. I need your help.   BARTOK          Hey, she's just a kid. And she's          going to Paris outta sight,          outta mind, outta Russia.   RASPUTIN          I cursed then all!   BARTOK          My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not          the brightest bat in the world -          she used to hang right side up,          anyway she always said "Curses          were made to be broken". Course,          she said it in those irritating          little bat squeaks, so it wasn't          quite so profound...   RASPUTIN          The Romanovs tried to kill me and          I swore to destroy all of them!          If she lives, if she should have          a child someday, the Romanov Family          continues! And I won't lot that          happen! THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE!   BARTOK          You know, this is really obsessive          behavior. There is this doctor this          doctor in Austria, Sigmund something          and he feels. . .    RASPUTIN          YOU IDIOT   RASPUTIN (CONT.)                  (to Reliquary)          Yesses - you'd all like to get          out, wouldn' t you? Sorry          just one at a time and only          when I call.   RASPUTIN                  (to Bartok)          Do you have any idea what would          happen if that broke?!   BARTOK                  (voice under glass)          You'd lose your security deposit?   RASPUTIN                  (waving reliquary)          Evil, powerful beings - I have          their power only if I contain          them, control them. If they          should all be released at          once... well ...   RASPUTIN (CONT.)          YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND          IF THAT HAPPENS!   RASPUTIN (CON'T.)                  (to reliquary)          Where is she? Where is          Princess Anastasia...   RASPUTIN(CONT.)          She has friends. No matter...   BARTOK          Ohhh, that was dumb...   BARTOK (CONT.)                  (calling to Rasputin)          Hello, I've get really terrible          claustrophobia. That's why I          could never live in a cave ...   RASPUTIN          Finish my prophecy...   BARTOK          Ew, I hate when he does this!   RASPUTIN          She is not to get off that          train... alive!   RASPUTIN          Go! I don't care what you do with the          others but finish the girl! KILLLLL HERRRRR!                  (sinister)          And have fun...   TATIANA          Take her away, Sophie.   TATIANA          Haven't anything better to do          than to break my heart.   TATIANA (CONT.)                  (quietly)          No more. So more...   SOPHIE                  (very rapidly)          Oh, oh... I must say. I thought          that one was bar - i'm just so          shocked that she wasn't real well,          she was real, I mean she was human,          of course. but not our real. I must          say, even my sisters were touched          by her yes - yes they were...   SOPHIE (CONT.)          ... moved to tears of joy! We won't          be f ooled next time, girls! I'm a          going to think of really hard questions...   TATIANA                 (stopping Sophie with                  a raise of her hand)          No, Sophie. My heart can't take it          anymore! I will see no more girls          claiming to be Anastasia._sent_trans_cons_label_2  DMITRI          Hurry up with those papers.   VLADIMIR          Would you have leaned over          Rembrant's shoulder and told          him to paint faster?   VLADIMIR (CONT.)          You probably would.                  (hands his the papers)          They're still wet.   VLADIMIR (CONT.)          Wake up, young lady, that's our train.   DMITRI                  (correcting)          "Wake up, your highness" - we should          start getting used to saying it.   VLADIMIR          What a world - a man who was in          my position in society is calling          a peasant 'Your Highness".   DMITRI                  (to Anya)          Wake up!   VLADIMER          We have a lot of work to do...   DMITRI          Come on!   DMITRI          Take my hand!   DMITRI          Do you always punch people first          thing in the morning?   ANYA          Sorry - it's a reflex. Living          in an orphanage if someone bothers          you - you automatically come up          swinging.   DMITRI          I wasn't bothering you. I was          trying to wake you up!   ANYA          By pulling my hair?!   DMITRI          I was all out of dynamite!   ANYA                  (hands Dmitri the snow)          Put it on your nose.

GUARD          Papers!   VLADIMIR                  (sheepishly)          It's what I hate about this          government - everything in red!   GUARD          Thank you, Comrade Zhivago.
